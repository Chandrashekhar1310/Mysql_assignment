    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on a tabular schema, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows. SQL databases use a set of standardized commands, known as SQL, to access and manipulate data. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex querying, and for applications that need to maintain strong data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are based on a non-tabular schema and use a more flexible data model, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph, or column-family. NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and can handle unstructured and semi-structured data more efficiently than SQL databases. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high scalability and availability, as well as for applications that deal with large volumes of data."

    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following statement adds a new column called \"department\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",

A table can have only one primary key, and it must be unique and not null.\n",
